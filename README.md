## How to contribute

Most edits go in **`webpage.html`** (syntax guide in the HTML comment; content in the `<script id="page-content">` block from `## INTRO`). Detail pages live in **`details/`** as plain `.txt` files — one per topic, created only when there is content (see [`details/EDITOR-GUIDE.md`](details/EDITOR-GUIDE.md) and e.g. `details/setting-stage.txt`).

1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub (or clone if you are a collaborator).
2. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b small-description # could also be your name
   ```
3. **Edit**, commit, and push your branch:
   ```bash
   git add webpage.html   # and/or details/, scripts/, etc.
   git commit -m "Brief summary of what changed and why"
   git push -u origin feature/short-description
   ```
4. **Open a Pull Request** to `main` on GitHub. Describe the change in a few sentences.
5. After review and merge, the site is updated from `main` (maintainers use `push.sh` to publish to GitHub Pages).
